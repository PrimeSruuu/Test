Machine learning for predicting Space Debris Collision Risk.

1. **3D Earth Visualization**  
   - Use **CesiumJS** to render only **Earth** (no unnecessary UI elements like timelines or credits).  

2. **Real-Time Space Debris & Satellite Tracking**  
   - Fetch **real-time TLE (Two-Line Element) data** from **Celestrak**.  
   - Show **moving** satellites and debris (not static).  
   - Display **accurate orbital paths/trajectories** around Earth.  

3. **Interactive Object Selection**  
   - Clicking on a **satellite or debris** should open a smooth **info panel**.  
   - This panel will display **basic details** and **collision risk** (predicted using your ML model).  

4. **ML Model Integration**  
   - Your trained ML model from **GitHub** will predict **collision risk**.  
   - The model should run **asynchronously** to avoid performance lag.  
   - **Highlight risky objects** in the UI and **notify users** about potential threats.  

5. **Timeline & Dropdown Navigation**  
   - A **timeline** (like NASAâ€™s Eyes on the Solar System) to show **past & future paths**.  
   - A **dropdown menu** to filter between **satellites and debris**.  
   - Selecting a **specific object** from the list should **focus the camera on it**.  

6. **Performance Optimization**  
   - Use **Level of Detail (LOD) rendering** for better performance.  
   - Use **Web Workers** for parallel processing.  
   - **Cache TLE data** to reduce API calls but refresh periodically.  
   - **GPU acceleration** to enhance real-time rendering.  

7. **Dynamic & Professional UI**  
   - **Smooth zoom, pan, rotate** controls.  
   - Show **real-time telemetry data** for each object.  
   - The UI should be **clean and professional** (only **HTML, CSS, JS**).  

Basically, you want a **NASA-like interactive 3D space debris tracker** that uses **real-time data** and **ML-based collision prediction**, with **smooth UI interactions and optimized performance**.
